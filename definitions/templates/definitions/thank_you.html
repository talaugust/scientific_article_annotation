		            <p> <strong> Please remember that you can only complete the task once. </strong> </p>

					<p> This task is part of a study on how people read and assess machine-generated text. As text generation models improve and generate longer, better text, we want to know how well people are able to distinguish between human- and machine-generated text and if there are ways to improve peopleâ€™s ability to do this.</p>

					<p> This is still preliminary work, but if you are interested to know more or have questions about the task, please contact us through the Amazon Mechanical Turk platform.</p>

					<p> Thank you!</p>
