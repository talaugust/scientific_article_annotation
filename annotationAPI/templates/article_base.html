            <h5>Research motivation</h5>
            <p>We are studying what people pick up on when reading news about scientific and medical findings.</p>
            <h5>Data collection &amp; sharing</h5>
            <p>We will not ask you for your name, and the data collected in this study will be made unidentifiable to the best of our ability. We will securely store the data on our servers and only share with qualified researchers. If you later decide that you do not want your responses included in this study, please email so we can exclude your work.</p>
            <p><small>If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, or wish to obtain information, ask questions or discuss any concerns about this study with someone other than the researcher(s), please contact the University of Washington Human Subjects Division at 206-543-0098 (for international calls include the US Calling Code: +1-206-543-0098).</small></p>
            <h5>FAQ</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><p><strong>Do I need to be a doctor or scientist to do this HIT?</strong></p>
              <p>No! People of all backgrounds are welcome to perform this study. Unlike many annotation tasks, we are not looking for the "correct" answer, just a good faith effort at reading and answering questions about the text.</p></li>

              <li><p><strong>How should I label the annotations?</strong></p>
                <p>The sections below will instruct you on how to label the annotations.</p>
              </li>

              <li><p><strong>What demographic information <em>will</em> be collected?</strong></p>
                <p>Age, gender, native language, and background/engagement in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and math). We won't collect any personally identifying information (like your name).</p>
              </li>

              <li><p><strong>Will any of my responses be saved before I submit the HIT?</strong></p>
                <p>Your annotations will be saved and updated when you highlight sections of the article. As a result, please make sure you only highlight when asked to, and that all highlights you make are finalized when you hit the submit button.</p>
              </li>
              <li><p><strong>Can I do this HIT multiple times?</strong></p>
                <p>For now, no, though this study may inform related HITs in the future.</p></li>
              <li><p><strong>What if I have additional questions?</strong></p>
                <p>Please reach out to Tal August (taugust@cs.washington.edu). Thanks!</p>

                <p> Scientific news articles often talk about the real world impact of the science or findings being reported. This can include future technologies or breakthroughs the findings might enable, or the societal implications of the findings. These sentences can occur anywhere in the article. Some examples are below: </p>

                <p> ““These ancient seeds might represent lost genetic diversity we don’t see any more,” Pérez-Escobar says. As date-palm growers adapt to climate change and battle pests and diseases, they might want to tap into the pool of ancient genes hidden in archaeological archives.”</p>

                <p> “Insects like fireflies tend to be critical to their ecosystems. Their disappearance could create havoc with food webs, especially for the birds and other animals that feed on them.”</p>

                <p><strong>  Please label the all sentences that state real world impact with the label 'IMPACT'. </strong> </p>
